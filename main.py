# PriorityQueue Scratchpad
# Brook Hamilton
# Use this as a "scratchpad" to tinker with your job, priority queue, and heap.

# from job import Job
# from max_heap import MaxHeap
# from priority_queue import PriorityQueue


# Example
# ages = PriorityQueue()
# print(ages)
list = []
value = (5, "hello")
list.append(value)

print (list)
