# PriorityQueue Scratchpad
# Brook Hamilton
# Use this as a "scratchpad" to tinker with your job, priority queue, and heap.

# from job import Job
# from max_heap import MaxHeap
# from priority_queue import PriorityQueue


# Example
# ages = PriorityQueue()
# print(ages)
# list = sorted([])
# value1 = (5, "hello")
# value2 = (8, "po")
# value3 = (1, "fa")
# list.append(value1)
# list.append(value2)
# list.append(value3)


# print (list)
inc = 0
for inc in range(10):
    inc += 1
    print (inc)
